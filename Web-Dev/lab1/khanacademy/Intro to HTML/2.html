    <h2>You can Learn Anything</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Nobody’s born smart.</em> We all start at <strong>0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        <strong>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.</strong><br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <strong>Failing</strong> is just another word for <em>growing.</em> And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet.</em><br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
